- [SystemMathUsageAnalyzer.cs](NeoContractAnalyzer/SystemMathUsageAnalyzer.cs): This analyzer flags usage of certain System.Math methods that are not supported in Neo smart contracts.
- [BigIntegerUsageAnalyzer.cs](NeoContractAnalyzer/BigIntegerUsageAnalyzer.cs): This analyzer checks for specific methods of the BigInteger class that are not supported.
- [StringMethodUsageAnalyzer.cs](NeoContractAnalyzer/StringMethodUsageAnalyzer.cs): This analyzer identifies and reports specific methods of the string class that are not supported.
- [BigIntegerCreationAnalyzer.cs](NeoContractAnalyzer/BigIntegerCreationAnalyzer.cs): This analyzer checks for creation patterns of the BigInteger class that are not supported.
- [InitialValueAnalyzer.cs](NeoContractAnalyzer/InitialValueAnalyzer.cs): This analyzer suggests converting attribute-based initializations to literal initializations for certain types.
- [RefKeywordUsageAnalyzer.cs](NeoContractAnalyzer/RefKeywordUsageAnalyzer.cs): This analyzer flags the usage of the 'ref' keyword, which might not be supported in smart contracts.
- [LinqUsageAnalyzer.cs](NeoContractAnalyzer/LinqUsageAnalyzer.cs): This analyzer detects usage of LINQ methods which are not supported in smart contracts.
- [CharMethodsUsageAnalyzer.cs](NeoContractAnalyzer/CharMethodsUsageAnalyzer.cs): This analyzer reports specific methods of the char class that are not recommended for use in smart contracts.
- [CollectionTypesUsageAnalyzer.cs](NeoContractAnalyzer/CollectionTypesUsageAnalyzer.cs): This analyzer flags the usage of unsupported collection types like List and Dictionary.

- [SmartContractMethodNamingAnalyzerUnderline.cs](NeoContractAnalyzer/SmartContractMethodNamingAnalyzerUnderline.cs): This analyzer warns about smart contract method names containing underscores.
- [SupportedStandardsAnalyzer.cs](NeoContractAnalyzer/SupportedStandardsAnalyzer.cs): This analyzer checks for correct implementation of supported standards in smart contracts.
- [BigIntegerUsingUsageAnalyzer.cs](NeoContractAnalyzer/BigIntegerUsingUsageAnalyzer.cs): This analyzer warns about incorrect usage of BigInteger in using statements.
- [StaticFieldInitializationAnalyzer.cs](NeoContractAnalyzer/StaticFieldInitializationAnalyzer.cs): This analyzer checks for proper initialization of static fields in smart contracts.
- [MultipleCatchBlockAnalyzer.cs](NeoContractAnalyzer/MultipleCatchBlockAnalyzer.cs): This analyzer checks for multiple catch blocks in try statements.

## How to Use

To use these analyzers in your Neo smart contract project:

1. Add a reference to the Neo.SmartContract.Analyzer project in your smart contract project.
2. Build the Neo.SmartContract.Analyzer project.
3. The analyzers will automatically run when you build your smart contract project.
