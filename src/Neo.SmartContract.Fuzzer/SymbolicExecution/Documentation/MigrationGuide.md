# Migration Guide: From Monolithic to Refactored Symbolic Virtual Machine

This document outlines the step-by-step process for migrating from the current monolithic SymbolicVirtualMachine to the refactored component-based design.

## Migration Strategy

We'll follow an incremental, controlled migration approach that ensures continuous functionality throughout the transition:

1. Use feature flags to control which implementation is active
2. Run tests against both implementations to verify equivalence
3. Migrate functionality one component at a time
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation (Current)

✅ Document the existing implementation  
✅ Create refactored component designs  
✅ Establish test coverage baseline  
✅ Create compatibility wrapper  

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Next)

1. Implement operation interfaces and base classes
2. Create evaluation services
3. Implement utility classes
4. Update SymbolicVirtualMachineWrapper to handle both implementations

### Phase 3: Component Migration (Incremental)

Migrate functionality in this order:

1. **Stack Operations**
   - Simple push/pop operations
   - Stack manipulation (DUP, SWAP)
   
2. **Terminal Operations**
   - RET, ABORT, THROW handlers
   
3. **Arithmetic Operations**
   - Basic arithmetic (ADD, SUB, etc.)
   - Numeric operations
   
4. **Comparison Operations**
   - Equality testing (EQUAL, NOTEQUAL)
   - Relational operators (LT, GT, etc.)
   - ByteString comparison
   
5. **Flow Control Operations**
   - Unconditional jumps (JMP)
   - Conditional jumps (JMPIF, JMPIFNOT)
   - Path constraints and feasibility
   
6. **Syscall Operations**
   - Native contract interactions
   - System calls

### Phase 4: Testing and Verification

1. Run full test suite against both implementations
2. Compare execution paths and results
3. Measure performance differences
4. Fix any discrepancies

### Phase 5: Final Switchover

1. Make refactored implementation the default
2. Update SymbolicExecutionEngine to use refactored VM
3. Add deprecation notice to original implementation
4. Remove original implementation in future release

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Testing

- Create equivalence tests that verify both implementations produce the same results
- Use existing integration tests to validate behavior
- Add new tests for edge cases specific to component boundaries

### Component Testing

- Unit test each operation component in isolation
- Test evaluation services with a variety of inputs
- Verify utility classes thoroughly

### Compatibility Testing

- Ensure SymbolicExecutionEngine works with the refactored VM
- Verify detector compatibility
- Confirm all syscalls function correctly

## Addressing Common Issues

### Handling Edge Cases

- Path exploration differences due to constraint solver integration
- ByteString comparison with symbolic variables
- ABORT opcode handling (previously fixed)

### Performance Considerations

- Monitor execution time for both implementations
- Check memory usage patterns
- Optimize critical paths based on profiling

### Error Handling

- Ensure all exceptions are properly propagated
- Maintain consistent logging patterns
- Provide detailed error information for debugging

## Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing refactored components, focus on:

- Is functionality preserved?
- Are error cases handled appropriately?
- Does the component integrate properly with others?
- Is the interface clean and well-documented?
- Are tests comprehensive?

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during migration:

1. Revert to original implementation using feature flag
2. Document the specific issues encountered
3. Create targeted tests to reproduce problems
4. Fix issues in the refactored implementation
5. Retry migration

## Success Criteria

The migration is considered successful when:

- All tests pass with the refactored implementation
- No regressions are observed in behavior
- Code quality metrics improve
- File sizes conform to standards (< 500 lines)
- Documentation is complete and accurate
