# SymbolicVirtualMachine Refactoring Plan

## Current Challenges

The `SymbolicVirtualMachine.cs` class currently has over 1000 lines of code, making it:
- Difficult to maintain
- Hard to understand
- Challenging to test individual components
- Prone to regression issues when making changes

## Refactoring Goals

1. Improve code maintainability by separating concerns
2. Enhance readability by organizing code logically
3. Facilitate targeted testing of components
4. Promote better code organization
5. Support future extension of the symbolic execution engine
6. Keep files under 500 lines according to code style guidelines

## Proposed File Structure

We'll break down the monolithic `SymbolicVirtualMachine.cs` into the following logical components:

### Core Classes

1. **SymbolicVirtualMachine.cs** (180-250 lines)
   - Core class with constructor, fields, and primary execution loop
   - State management (CurrentState, PendingStates)
   - Main execution methods (Execute, ExecuteStep)
   - Logging utilities
   - Dependency injection

### Operation Classes

2. **Operations/StackOperations.cs** (100-150 lines)
   - Methods for stack manipulation (PUSH, POP, DUP, etc.)
   - Specialized handling for different stack instructions
   - Helper methods for stack operations

3. **Operations/ArithmeticOperations.cs** (100-150 lines)
   - Methods for arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, etc.)
   - Handling of numeric operations with different types
   - Helper methods for arithmetic evaluation

4. **Operations/ComparisonOperations.cs** (100-150 lines)
   - Methods for comparison operations (EQUAL, LT, GT, etc.)
   - ByteString comparison handling
   - Special case handling for symbolic vs. concrete values

5. **Operations/FlowControlOperations.cs** (150-200 lines)
   - Methods for flow control operations (JMP, JMPIF, JMPIFNOT)
   - Conditional execution path handling 
   - Logic for constraint generation during path exploration

6. **Operations/SyscallOperations.cs** (100-150 lines)
   - Methods for system call operations
   - Contract interaction handling
   - Native contract calls

### Evaluation Classes

7. **Evaluation/ConcreteEvaluation.cs** (100-150 lines)
   - Methods for evaluating concrete operations
   - Type-specific operations for integers, booleans, etc.
   - Evaluation of binary and unary operations on concrete values

8. **Evaluation/SymbolicEvaluation.cs** (100-150 lines)
   - Methods for creating and manipulating symbolic expressions
   - Handling of symbolic constraints 
   - Integration with constraint solver

### Helper Classes

9. **Utils/ByteStringOperations.cs** (50-100 lines)
   - ByteString-specific utility methods
   - Methods for handling ByteString operations
   - ByteString comparison helpers

## Implementation Strategy

1. Create base interfaces to define operation contracts
2. Extract methods from the original class to their respective new files
3. Update the main SymbolicVirtualMachine class to use the extracted components
4. Ensure proper namespace organization and access modifiers
5. Validate through comprehensive testing after each extraction

## Code Organization Principles

1. Each file should have a clear and focused responsibility
2. Method signatures should be consistent across files
3. Use dependency injection to manage dependencies between components
4. Maintain clear XML documentation for all public members
5. Ensure backward compatibility with existing tests
6. Keep each file under 500 lines according to code style guidelines

## Testing Strategy

1. Maintain existing integration tests
2. Add unit tests for each extracted component
3. Ensure all execution paths are tested
4. Verify results match the original implementation
