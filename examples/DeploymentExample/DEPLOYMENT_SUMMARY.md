# Neo Smart Contract Deployment Example - Summary

## Overview
This example demonstrates a complete multi-contract deployment scenario using the Neo Smart Contract Deployment Toolkit. The project includes three interrelated contracts with proper dependency management and cross-contract interactions.

## Contracts

### 1. Token Contract (NEP-17)
- **Purpose**: Fungible token with governance integration
- **Features**:
  - Standard NEP-17 implementation
  - Minting and burning capabilities (governance-controlled)
  - Pausable transfers
  - Total supply: 100 million tokens (8 decimals)

### 2. NFT Contract (NEP-11)
- **Purpose**: Non-fungible tokens with token-based minting
- **Features**:
  - Standard NEP-11 implementation
  - Requires payment in tokens to mint NFTs
  - Customizable properties for each NFT
  - Integration with governance system

### 3. Governance Contract
- **Purpose**: DAO governance system for managing other contracts
- **Features**:
  - Proposal creation and voting
  - Council member management
  - Execution of approved proposals
  - Token-based voting power

## Key Features Demonstrated

1. **Multi-Contract Deployment**: Sequential deployment with dependency management
2. **Cross-Contract Interactions**: Contracts calling each other's methods
3. **Configuration Management**: Using appsettings.json for deployment configuration
4. **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive unit tests for each contract
5. **Deployment Automation**: Automated deployment and configuration scripts

## Build and Deployment

### 1. Compile Contracts
```bash
cd examples/DeploymentExample
bash build-contracts.sh
```

### 2. Run Tests
```bash
dotnet test
```

### 3. Deploy Contracts
```bash
cd deploy/DeploymentExample.Deploy
dotnet run multi
```

## Contract Interactions

1. **Token → NFT**: NFT minting requires token payment
2. **Token → Governance**: Voting power based on token balance
3. **Governance → Token**: Can execute mint/burn proposals
4. **Governance → NFT**: Can manage NFT contract settings

## Configuration

The deployment uses `appsettings.json` for configuration:
- Network settings (mainnet, testnet, local)
- Wallet configuration
- Deployment parameters (gas limits, fees, etc.)

## Testing

Each contract has comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Basic functionality
- Edge cases
- Cross-contract interactions
- Security scenarios

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to testnet/mainnet
2. Implement additional governance features
3. Add more complex cross-contract scenarios
4. Create frontend application for user interaction
