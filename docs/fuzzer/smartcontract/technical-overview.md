### Core Components

1. **Parameter Generator**: Generates diverse inputs for contract methods based on their parameter types.

2. **Contract Executor**: Executes the contract with generated inputs using the Neo VM.

3. **Symbolic Execution Engine**: Explores multiple execution paths by treating inputs as symbolic values.

4. **Vulnerability Detectors**: Analyze execution traces to identify potential vulnerabilities.

5. **Coverage Tracker**: Monitors which parts of the contract are executed during fuzzing.

6. **Constraint Solver**: Solves path constraints to generate inputs that reach specific execution paths.

7. **Result Analyzer**: Processes execution results to identify interesting behaviors.

8. **Configuration Manager**: Manages fuzzer settings and options.

## Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - Load the NEF and manifest files
   - Parse configuration options
   - Initialize components

2. **Method Analysis**:
   - Extract methods from the contract manifest
   - Filter methods based on inclusion/exclusion lists

3. **Fuzzing Loop**:
   - For each method:
     - Generate parameters
     - Execute the method
     - Track coverage
     - Analyze results
     - Save execution details

4. **Symbolic Execution**:
   - Create symbolic variables for method parameters
   - Execute the contract symbolically
   - Explore multiple execution paths
   - Identify potential vulnerabilities

5. **Reporting**:
   - Generate coverage reports
   - Compile vulnerability findings
   - Create summary reports

## Key Classes and Their Responsibilities

### `SmartContractFuzzer`

The main class that orchestrates the fuzzing process. It:
- Initializes components
- Manages the fuzzing workflow
- Coordinates between different components

### `ParameterGenerator`

Responsible for generating diverse inputs for contract methods. It:
- Creates inputs based on parameter types
- Ensures inputs are valid for the Neo VM
- Supports various Neo-specific types (UInt160, ECPoint, etc.)

### `ContractExecutor`

Executes the contract with generated inputs. It:
- Sets up the execution environment
- Handles method invocation
- Captures execution results
- Manages gas consumption

### `SymbolicExecutionEngine`

Explores multiple execution paths by treating inputs as symbolic values. It:
- Creates symbolic variables for inputs
- Executes operations symbolically
- Maintains path constraints
- Forks execution states at branch points

### `VulnerabilityDetector`

Base class for detectors that identify potential vulnerabilities. Implementations include:
- `IntegerOverflowDetector`
- `ReentrancyDetector`
- `UnauthorizedAccessDetector`
- `StorageManipulationDetector`
- `NeoNativeContractDetector`
- `OracleVulnerabilityDetector`
- `TokenImplementationDetector`

### `CoverageTracker`

Tracks which parts of the contract are executed during fuzzing. It:
- Monitors instruction execution
- Calculates coverage metrics
- Generates coverage reports

### `FuzzerConfiguration`

Manages fuzzer settings and options. It:
- Loads configuration from files or command-line arguments
- Provides default values
- Validates configuration options

## Symbolic Execution in Detail

The symbolic execution engine is a key component that enables the fuzzer to explore multiple execution paths without concrete inputs. It works by:

1. **Symbolic Values**: Treating inputs as symbols rather than concrete values
2. **Path Constraints**: Maintaining constraints that must be satisfied for each execution path
3. **State Forking**: Creating new execution states at branch points
4. **Constraint Solving**: Using a constraint solver to generate concrete inputs for each path

For more details on symbolic execution, see the [Symbolic Execution](./symbolic-execution.md) document.

## Vulnerability Detection

The fuzzer includes several vulnerability detectors that analyze execution traces to identify potential issues. These detectors look for patterns that indicate common vulnerabilities in smart contracts, such as:

- Integer overflow/underflow
- Reentrancy attacks
- Unauthorized access
- Storage manipulation
- Improper use of native contracts
- Oracle vulnerabilities
- Token implementation issues

For more details on vulnerability detection, see the [Vulnerability Detection](./vulnerability-detection.md) document.

## Integration with Neo VM

The fuzzer integrates with the Neo VM to execute contracts. It:

1. Loads the contract from NEF and manifest files
2. Sets up the execution environment
3. Invokes methods with generated parameters
4. Captures execution results, including:
   - Return values
   - Gas consumption
   - Notifications
   - Exceptions
   - Storage changes

This integration allows the fuzzer to accurately simulate how the contract would behave on the Neo blockchain.

## Performance Considerations

The fuzzer includes several optimizations to improve performance:

- **Caching**: Caching execution results to avoid redundant computations
- **Parallel Execution**: Running multiple fuzzing iterations in parallel
- **Selective Symbolic Execution**: Using symbolic execution only for complex paths
- **Constraint Simplification**: Simplifying path constraints to improve solver performance
- **Incremental Solving**: Reusing solver results for similar constraints

These optimizations help the fuzzer handle complex contracts with many execution paths.
