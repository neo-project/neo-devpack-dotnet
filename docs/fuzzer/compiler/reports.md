}
```

## Log Files

Log files are text files in the `Logs` directory within the output directory. They contain detailed logs of the fuzzing process, including information, warnings, errors, and debug messages.

## Checkpoint Reports

During long-running fuzzing sessions, the Neo Compiler Fuzzer generates checkpoint reports at regular intervals. These reports are similar to the final summary report and statistics file but are generated at intermediate points during the fuzzing process.

Checkpoint reports are saved in the `Checkpoints` directory within the output directory, with filenames that include timestamps:

- `DynamicContractFuzzerReport_Checkpoint_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`
- `Statistics_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

## Interpreting Reports

### Success Rate

The success rate indicates the percentage of contracts that compiled successfully. A higher success rate indicates that the Neo N3 compiler is more robust in handling the generated contracts.

### Feature Success Rates

The feature success rates indicate the success rate for each feature. Features with lower success rates may have issues or incompatibilities with other features.

### Detailed Results

The detailed results section lists all contracts with their status and features. This can help identify specific combinations of features that cause compilation failures.

### Execution Environment

The execution environment section provides information about the environment in which the fuzzer was run, including the operating system, .NET version, and machine details.

## Using Reports for Analysis

The reports and statistics generated by the Neo Compiler Fuzzer can be used for various types of analysis:

### Identifying Problematic Features

Features with low success rates may have issues or incompatibilities with other features. By analyzing the feature success rates, you can identify features that need further investigation.

### Tracking Progress Over Time

By comparing reports from different fuzzing sessions, you can track the progress of the Neo N3 compiler over time. Improvements in success rates indicate that the compiler is becoming more robust.

### Identifying Regression Issues

If a feature that previously had a high success rate suddenly has a lower success rate, it may indicate a regression issue in the Neo N3 compiler.

### Prioritizing Development Efforts

Features with low success rates can be prioritized for development efforts to improve the robustness of the Neo N3 compiler.

## Conclusion

The Neo Compiler Fuzzer generates detailed reports and statistics that provide valuable insights into the robustness of the Neo N3 compiler. By analyzing these reports, you can identify issues, track progress, and prioritize development efforts to improve the compiler.
