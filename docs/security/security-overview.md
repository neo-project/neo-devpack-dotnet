# Neo Smart Contract Security Overview

Essential security principles and quick reference for developing secure smart contracts on Neo N3.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
Multiple security layers, never single points of failure.

### 2. Fail-Safe Defaults
Systems fail securely when unexpected conditions occur.

### 3. Principle of Least Privilege
Grant only minimum necessary permissions.

### 4. Input Validation
Never trust external data without validation.

### 5. State Consistency
Maintain data integrity across all operations.

## Critical Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Risk Level | Prevention |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| **Reentrancy** | ðŸ”´ Critical | Use reentrancy guards, state-before-calls pattern |
| **Integer Overflow** | ðŸ”´ Critical | Implement safe arithmetic operations |
| **Access Control Bypass** | ðŸ”´ Critical | Always use `Runtime.CheckWitness()` |
| **Storage Manipulation** | ðŸŸ¡ High | Implement proper key isolation and validation |
| **Gas DoS** | ðŸŸ¡ High | Limit loop iterations and batch sizes |
| **Weak Randomness** | ðŸŸ¡ High | Use commit-reveal schemes, multiple entropy sources |

## Security Checklist

### Before Development
- [ ] Define security requirements and threat model
- [ ] Plan access control architecture
- [ ] Identify external dependencies and risks

### During Development
- [ ] Validate all external inputs
- [ ] Implement proper access controls
- [ ] Use safe arithmetic operations
- [ ] Follow secure storage patterns
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Complete security testing
- [ ] Run static analysis tools
- [ ] Conduct code review
- [ ] Verify gas optimization doesn't compromise security
- [ ] Review deployment checklist

## Emergency Response

If you discover a security issue:
1. **Stop** - Halt any risky operations immediately
2. **Assess** - Determine scope and impact
3. **Contain** - Implement immediate protective measures
4. **Fix** - Develop and test security patches
5. **Deploy** - Update contracts following security procedures
6. **Monitor** - Watch for any ongoing issues
