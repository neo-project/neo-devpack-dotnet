## Quick Start Security Checklist

Before deploying any smart contract to Neo N3, ensure you have:

- [ ] Implemented proper access control mechanisms
- [ ] Protected against reentrancy attacks
- [ ] Validated all external inputs
- [ ] Used safe arithmetic operations
- [ ] Secured storage operations
- [ ] Tested with comprehensive security test cases
- [ ] Reviewed code with security-focused static analysis
- [ ] Followed the deployment security checklist

## Security-First Development

Security should be considered from the beginning of your smart contract development process, not as an afterthought. This guide provides the knowledge and tools necessary to build secure, robust smart contracts on the Neo N3 platform.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover security vulnerabilities in the Neo DevPack or related tools, please report them responsibly to the Neo development team through the appropriate security channels.
