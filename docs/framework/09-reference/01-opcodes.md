# NeoVM Opcodes

Neo smart contracts, when compiled, result in NeoVM bytecode, which is a series of low-level instructions (opcodes) executed by the Neo Virtual Machine.

Understanding these opcodes can be helpful for advanced debugging, optimization, and comprehending the underlying execution model, although it's not typically required for standard C# development using the framework.

## Official Reference

The definitive list and description of Neo N3 VM opcodes can be found in the official Neo developer documentation:

*   **[Neo N3 VM Opcode Reference](https://developers.neo.org/docs/n3/reference/neovm/opcodes/stack)**

This reference details each opcode, its function, stack behavior, and GAS cost.
