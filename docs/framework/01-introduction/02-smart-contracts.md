# What are Smart Contracts?

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They run on a blockchain, making them immutable (unchangeable) and distributed (spread across many computers).

## Core Principles

*   **Automation:** Code executes automatically when predefined conditions are met, removing the need for intermediaries.
*   **Trustlessness:** Parties can interact directly without relying on a central authority because the blockchain enforces the contract rules.
*   **Transparency:** Contract code and transaction history are often publicly viewable on the blockchain (though privacy mechanisms can exist).
*   **Security:** Cryptography secures transactions and the contract's integrity.
*   **Immutability:** Once deployed on the blockchain, the core logic of a smart contract typically cannot be altered (though upgrade mechanisms exist).

## Use Cases

Smart contracts enable a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps), including:

*   Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
*   Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
*   Supply Chain Management
*   Voting Systems
*   Gaming
*   Digital Identity

On Neo, smart contracts are executed by the Neo Virtual Machine (NeoVM).
