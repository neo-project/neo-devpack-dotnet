# Framework Features (`Neo.SmartContract.Framework`)

The `Neo.SmartContract.Framework` NuGet package is the cornerstone of C# smart contract development on Neo. It provides the necessary classes, methods, attributes, and services to interact with the Neo blockchain environment from within your C# code.

This section explores the key features provided by the framework.

## Topics

*   [Storage](./01-storage.md): Reading from and writing to the contract's persistent storage.
*   [Runtime Services](./02-runtime.md): Accessing blockchain state, context, logging, notifications, and checking witnesses.
*   [Events](./03-events.md): Defining and emitting events for off-chain applications.
*   [Contract Interaction](./04-contract-interaction.md): Calling other smart contracts.
*   [Native Contracts](./05-native-contracts/README.md): Interacting with Neo's built-in system contracts (Ledger, NEO, GAS, Policy, Oracle, etc.).
*   [Attributes](./06-attributes.md): Using attributes to control manifest generation and contract behavior.
*   [Helper Methods](./07-helper-methods.md): Utility functions for common tasks like type conversions and assertions.
